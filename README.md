Game Controls:
arrow keys to move in any direction

E = change magic (restore health or shoot flames)

      to spend experiance points on upgrading stats   
      
I wrote this code by following along with Clear Codes YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw).   
I followed the tutorial to research building my [6.0001 final project](https://github.com/4-Leafs-Code/4-leafs-pet) where   
I built an MVP version of a virtual pet.   

  I hope you enjoy the product of my first game code turtorial. I can't wait to show my son.
